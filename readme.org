* About

  Bindings to the BASS library for all kinds of crossplatform audio
  and streaming functionality.  

* Usage

  Check the native documentation for how to use the functions.  The
  functions just have a lispy name now.  Also, BASS has some really
  inconsistent constants it uses for flags and such so the SWIG tool
  was used without lispifying names.  That will be fixed.

* Issues
  
  Functions that involve callbacks seem to have an issue because the
  library appears to use threads in a way that breaks implementations.
  Everything else works though.
