* About

  Bindings to the BASS library for all kinds of crossplatform audio
  and streaming functionality.  

* Usage

  Check the native documentation for how to use the functions.  The
  functions just have a lispy name now.  Also, BASS has some really
  inconsistent constants it uses for flags and such so the SWIG tool
  was used without lispifying names.  There's inconsistency, but the
  inconvenience is certainly minor because I assume pretty much all
  use cases will just be playing samples without anything fancy.  Open
  an issue if it really bothers you and I'll probably listen.
  Anyways, if you need any help finding them, check out
  types-constants.lisp, but it's literally the same name.

* Issues
  
  Functions that involve callbacks seem to have an issue because the
  library appears to use threads in a way that breaks implementations.
  Everything else works though.
