* About

  Bindings to the BASS library for all kinds of audio and streaming functionality.

* Usage

  Check the native documentation for how to use the functions.  The
  functions just have a lispy name now.  Also, BASS has some really
  inconsistent constants it uses for flags and such so the SWIG tool
  was used without lispifying names.  There's inconsistency, but the
  inconvenience is certainly minor because I assume pretty much all
  use cases will just be playing samples without anything fancy.  If
  you need any help finding them, check out types-constants.lisp

* Issues
  
  Functions that involve callbacks seem to have an issue...
  Everything else works though
